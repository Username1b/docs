# Fusion Query Language

Fusion Query Language (FQL) is a powerful query language for Fusion Feed that enables a high degree of precision for searches.  The following REST endpoints support FQL queries:

- GET /play-search

## Syntax

Queries are provided as an argument for the filter.fql.query parameter. Each query consists of one or more clauses. Each FQL *clause* consists of either a *variable* or a *function* that evaluates to `true` or `false` to define a condition for the search.

The following operators are supported for constructing an FQL clause.

|Operator|Description|
|---|---|
|`=`|Equal|
|`!`|Not|
|`>`|Greater than|
|`<`|Less than|
|`>=`|Greater than or equal|
|`<=`|Less than or equal|

You can combine multiple clauses into a single search using the operators described in the following table.

|Operator|Description|
|---|---|
|`and`, `AND`|Returns results for which both clauses evaluate to `true`.|
|`or`, `OR`|Returns results for which at least one clause evaluates to `true`.|

## FQL Variables

The following tables describe variables that can be used to construct an FQL clause.

### String

FQL variables of the `string` type are typically used in clauses with the `=` operator to filter results by a specific ID or other identifying attribute. You can also use the `!` operator to exclude specific results. The following table describes FQL variables of the `string` type.

|Variable|Type|Description|Example|Sport|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`GAME_ID`|String|The game ID. You can get game IDs from the `/games` endpoint.|`GAME_ID="WCrh4GFerJpjEykCo6v9rU"`|All|
|`PLAY_ID`|String|The play ID. You can get play IDs from the `/plays` endpoint.|`PLAY_ID="T6nWouTeffDgrN6Hx1AFTM"`|All|
|`POSSESSION_TEAM_ABBREVIATION`|String|The abbreviated name of the team with possession at the start of the play.|`POSSESSION_TEAM_ABBREVIATION="USC"`|Gridiron football|
|`YARD_LINE_TEAM_ABBREVIATION`|String|The abbreviated name of the team on whose side of the field is the line of scrimmage at the start of the play.|`YARD_LINE_TEAM_ABBREVIATION="USC"`|Gridiron football|

### Number

FQL variables of the `number` type include statistical information (e.g., `PASSING_YARDS`) or game situation information (e.g.,`QUARTER`).

|Variable|Type|Description|Example|Sport|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`DOWN`|Number|The down on which the play occurs.|`DOWN=3`|Gridiron football|

|`SEASON`|Number|The season year.|`SEASON=2022`|Gridiron football|
|`WEEK`|Number|The week number of the game within a stage. For example, a value of `1` can refer to the first week of the preseason, the first week of the regular season, the first week of the postseason, or games that take place outside a season schedule such as exhibition games.|`WEEK=8`|Gridiron football|
|`YARD_LINE_NUMBER`|Number|The yard line at which the play occurred.|`YARD_LINE_NUMBER=20`|Gridiron football|
|`YARDS_TO_GO`|Number|The number of yards to go for a first down.|`YARDS_TO_GO>20`|Gridiron football|

### Boolean

FQL variables of the `boolean` type are useful for requesting results which a specified attribute is true. You can also use the `!` operator to exclude all results for which a specified attribute is true.
